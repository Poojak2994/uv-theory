All about my  UV sensor project:


UV radiation is classified into three primary types: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultra-
violet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC), based on their wavelengths. Almost
all of the UV radiation that reaches earth is UVA though some UVB radiation
reaches earth. Vitamin D is made when UV (more precisely, UVB rays) react
with a compound (7-dehydrocholesterol) in the skin. The best rays for UV syn-
thesis have wavelengths between 270–300 nm. These wavelengths are present
when the UV index is greater than 3 When your skin is exposed to sunlight,
it manufactures vitamin D. The sun’s ultraviolet B (UVB) rays interact with a
protein called 7-DHC in the skin, converting it into vitamin D3, the active form
of vitamin D.
The sun’s UVB rays help the skin synthesize vitamin D, which is essential
for human health, and especially for people with MS. ... Examples for UV
exposure. 15 - 20 mins UV index 5 - midday, uncovered 10 - 15 mins UV index
7 - midday, uncovered 5- 7 mins UV index 14 - midday, uncovered
